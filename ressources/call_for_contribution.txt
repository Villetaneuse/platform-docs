Dear Coq users and developpers,

We would like to shed some light on our new project "Coq Platform Doc".
Our goal is to provide tutorials and how-to guides for Coq and the Coq Platform,
to be included in the next Rocq website.

Our first (very preliminary) prototype is available on
https://www.theozimmermann.net/platform-docs/

It contains:
- a Search tutorial
- a Basic library file and module management tutorial
- 3 tutorials about the Equation plugin

The preliminary git repository is https://github.com/Zimmi48/platform-docs
and there is a dedicated zulip channel:
https://coq.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/437203-Coq-Platform-docs

A Coq Enhancement Proposal (CEP) has been proposed here:
https://github.com/coq/ceps/pull/91

Any contribution would be greatly appreciated and we welcome:
- reviews of our CEP
- comments or criticism about existing tutorials
- new tutorials about your favorite feature/plugin
- demands for specific tutorials
- propositions to enhance interactive and non-interactive interfaces for the
  tutorials
